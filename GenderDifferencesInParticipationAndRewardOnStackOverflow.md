### gender gap and IT
 In general we can observe a gap in wages between women and men in USA. A woman obtains 80 cents for each dollar gained by a man.

When entering IT studies, women has high drop_out rate than man because of low self confidence and the it being associated to masculine culture.

### Measuring inequalities

Many studies find out that the most frequently used online knowledge sources are often created by a small minority, because cultural and algorithmic features of the platform discourage women or other underprivileged groups from contributing and editing. 

The underrepresentation of women is more pronounced in content creation than participation.

Women are more likely to engage with a post on Stack Overﬂow if they see other women in the conversation 

## Background on StackOverFlow

Previous research has shown that anonymity impacts behavior [44], and it is possible that some users utilized an anonymous name in order to establish an independent identity women may pose as men if they feel that they will be taken more seriously or to avoid harassment.


## Result

### Descriptive statistics

The key dependent varibale will be `reputation`. The average reputation score is 1703 for men and 942 for women.
`In contrast to a 2012 study of men and women on Stack Overﬂow [58], which found that men are more active on the site across all measures, we ﬁnd that women are more likely to ask questions`

| Mean Activity| Women | Men |
--------------|-------|-----|
| Answers | 19.5 | 39.8 |
| Questions | 16.4 | 13.5 |
| Edits | 9.0 | 10.0 |
| Upvotes | 115.0 | 170.0 |
| Downlvotes | 14.6 | 21.9 |
| Account age (day) | 1728 | 1925 |

### Discussion of the result

- The activity difference drive inequality in success on stackoverflow (women asking and men responding) because of the actual reward system.
- Women in general hesitate to answer because of the lack of qualifications,  the size of the commuty and the negativity.
- Stack Overﬂow’s current system strongly incentivizes answering by rewarding upvotes on answers twice as much upvotes on questions

## Redesign the reward system to make a fair system to both particpant

Increasing rewards to good questions may help to make the site more inclusive by oﬀering a less competitive and speed-oriented way to build one’s reputation.

After the revision on the reward system, note that although women have higher median in the revised reputation plot, men still have higher average reputation as evidenced by their overrepresentation in the long-tail of success.


## Limitations

- The men and women in our data form a biased sample of all users of the site
- Data collected contains highly rate of errors due to name of the participants (not sure of the gender)
- Quality measurement 

***`Note: If women are answering fewer questions because they have been discouraged from speaking up, fear harassment, or lack self-conﬁdence, one cannot solve the overarching problem by increasing the rewards to questions.`***

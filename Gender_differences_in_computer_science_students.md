- `Unique approach: multivariate investigation`
- `The main objective: identify a profile of women and men who pursue carees in Computer Science`

***`Noteworthy: men had more confidence in using computers science than did women even when statistically controlling quantitative ability`***
Two reasons for the small number of women in CS are:
- negative stereotypes regarding the field
- low confidence


## Method

A Questionnaire was given to 56 students (24 females ans 32 males) during spring and fall 2001 Semester.

Two types of students were refered:

- majors: take required courses in CS  
- non-majors: take basic-level courses

Participants were paid $8 to fill out questionnaires assessing demographic information; ability in quantitative areas; educational goals and interests; experience with computers; stereotypes and knowledge about CS; confidence; personality; support and encouragement; stress and financial issues; gender discrimination; and attitudes towards CS courses and instructors.


## Results

### Demographic Variables

- 82% Caucasian
- 9% Hispanic
- 7% Asian
- 2% African American

 Non-majors were less likely to be married than were CS majors and had attended fewer semesters of study than CS majors.

### Ability in Quantitative Areas 

women, men, CS majors, and non-majors did not differ to a statistically significant degree in self-reported college GPA (a way of converting your grades into a numerical scale between 0 up to 4).

###  Educational Goals and Interests 

- Majors and non-majors and females and males alike thought that CS was a worthwhile major.

- Men had significantly higher educational aspirations than did women.

- Men valued extrinsic rewards more than did women

### Experience with computers

- Majors spent significantly more time than non-majors using a computer
- Marginally more males (90.6%) than females (58.3%) had programming experience. Significantly more men (72%) than women (38%) had installed RAM in a computer.

### Stereotypes and Knowledge about CS 

- There were no gender or major vs. non-major differences for the estimated number of hours typical computer scientists work
-  Whereas male and female CS majors gave similar estimates, female non-majors’ salary estimates were lower than male non-majors’
-  There were no gender or major vs. non-major differences for perceptions of CS being a good career for parents of young children because of extrinsic rewards or because of low levels of stress.

### Confidence

 Women had less confidence than did men, even with ACT scores controlled.

 At every level of quantitative ability and regardless of whether they are taking courses designed for majors or non-majors, females have less confidence in their computer aptitude than males

### Personality

 Female non-majors were less conscientious than male non-majors, whereas female CS majors were more conscientious than male CS majors.

### Support and Encouragement

Female participants reported more interpersonal attachment and connectedness with others than did males

### Stress and Finalcial Issues

There were no significant gender or major vs. non-major differences in stress, hours worked

#### financial sources

- parents
- student loans
- self (through employment or savings). 

### gender Discrimination

Overall, students believed that there was little gender discrimination against female students in the CS department.

###  Attitudes towards CS Courses and Instructors 

Non-majors, majors, women, and men had equally lukewarm perceptions of the faculty, the social atmosphere in the CS department, and programmatic issues.

### Discussion

Thus, the present research suggests that these variables are not the causes of the dearth of women in CS, saving us from expending effort to change these variables. Instead we should focus our energies on changing the variables that were found to negatively impact women in CS. 

*** `women in CS may suffer from stereotype threat, which “occurs when targets of stereotypes alleging intellectual inferiority are reminded of the possibility of confirming these stereotypes”` ***  

*** `Women who have supportive friends and family are more likely to major in CS [11]. `***

*** `Low computer confidence among women is a major barrier to women’s advancement in CS` ***

*** `One cause of women’s low confidence  less playful and relaxed attitude towards computers [21]` *** 

*** ` Indeed, women had somewhat less programming experience than men. This may be explained by the fact that their interest in programming develops at a later age than men’s [19]` ***

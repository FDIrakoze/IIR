## Introduction         

Industry needs people able to work in teams to develop and maintain software
Effective teamwork requires mastering specific abilities, such as leadership, coordination, conflict management and other skills

Women in science, technology, engineering, mathematics programs and careers is disproportionately lower than that of men.

Women and men may have different goals when they participate in project-oriented courses; women’s goals are more oriented towards teamwork and peer learning, than men 

Women are normally under-represented in IT educational programs and in the IT workforce 

two hypothesis were proposed to identify if there is a difference among the results of software engineering projects in academia related to gender : 
- mixed gender teams are more coordinated
-  the participation of women in software engineering teams makes teams work more effective 

Parnas defined three steps required to produce software engineering programs: 
- define the possible tasks that a software engineer is expected to perform,
- define a body of knowledge required for the software engineer, 
- transfer such knowledge as a training program


Glass point out that, When he entered the workforce in the late 50’ there were no shortage of women practitioner’s, but in the middle 80’s something changed and the rates of women entering the computer science field in general dropped out
The day when computer science began in Chile, report that there was a shortage of women since the beginning

The main idea of the software project courses is to simulate the reality of what they will face 
in real life when they start working in industry. In real life it is not feasible to choose to work just with one gender

## Experimentation Scenario  

Experimentation based on the university of Chile 

The primary goal of this course is to teach students software engineering in a ¨hands-on¨ way, by resembling an industrial setting. 

 - Students are put in team of 4-7 based on their capabilities by a MBTI based tool

 The projects are real projects that have real clients and a problem that can be solved with information system software that should be addressed in the 15-week course time frame

The evaluated items were the following: 
1. He/she assumes the project as a team effort, providing support in project tasks. 
2. He/she is able to seek help when problems are found. 
3. He/she fulfills his/her tasks properly, working transparently and generating the most value out of each working day. 
4. He/she demonstrates initiative to achieve project success. 
5. He/she shows a communicative attitude facilitating the teamwork. 
6. He/she has maintained good communication with client, generating value to project execution. 
7. He/she demonstrates interest in improving performance on the execution of his/her activities and role within the project. 
8. He/she is able to admit to mistakes and accept criticism. 

Five concepts for their interpretations : 
1. Commitment 
2. comunication
3. coordination
4. attitude
5. contribution

##  Results 

> H1 :  
mixed gender teams have better coordination than male gender teams   
The difference between mixed gender teams and male teams is 0.81; mixed gender teams are 20% higher in terms of self-perception than male teams. 
The other concepts have differences but they are not so significant as to be statistically valid (commitment 9.7%, communication 7.8%, attitude 9.6%, contribution 9.4%).  
Women performed all the team roles (project manager, tester, analyst, designer and developer); the only role that have just one female was the 
designer

>H2 :   
The grades of mixed gender teams are 16% higher when we are talking about project grades and 13% higher when we are talking about final grades.   
The mixed gender teams have 10 projects. From these, 9 of them were deployed resulting in a success rate of mixed gender teams of 90%  
The male teams have 17 projects and only 7 were implanted, so the success rate of male teams was 42%

**The participation of women on software engineering teams makes teams work more effective**

## Conclusion 

Unfortunately, female participation in software engineering (CS degree) is not so different from studies in other countries   
Mixed gender teams offer more coordination and focus to student teams, help them focus their efforts on what really matters   
Mixed gender teams in software engineering education improves the results of software engineering teams in academia. Students learn to work on real-world projects with substantially better results

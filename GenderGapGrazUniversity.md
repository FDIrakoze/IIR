# Resume

The aim of the survey at this university is to be able to answer to these questions:
- Are female students disadvantaged and thereby negatively affects their grades?

*** `we can see that gender is not significant whether one passes or fails the course hence females are not disadvantaged so that their performance is negatively impacted. Therefore RQ2 can be answered with no` ***

- Is there a difference between female and male students in their perceived CS educa-
tion prior to university and if, does this have an impact on their
academic performance? 

*** `No there was no gender difference on the number of students with prior courses in computer science` ***

 

- Do the self ratings of programming skills prior to the course differ between male and female students?  
*** ` Yes because female student intend to rate themselves at a maximum of 3/6 (good skills) but males at a maximum of 5/6 expert level` ***
- Do the self ratings of programming skills correlate with the course grades?
*** `we used the Spearman rank correlation test. Neither the female nor the male self-ratings correlated with the course grading` ***
- Do the self ratings of programming skills increase compared to the values before the course?
*** `Although there was a slight increase of the self ratingsâ€™ rank-correlation, from the pre-test to the post-test, this increase was also not statistically significant` ***


## Study

The experience took place at Graz university, the participant were Student from first grade in CS study. They were 72 females (22.5%) and 248 males (77.5%).

- 80% of the participant were graded
- 78% of females student finished positively and 65% for males students
- 35% of females student had programming courses in school against 45% of males.


## Conclusion

- Primarily it turned out, that performance differences between female and male students are not significant

- The number of female students in other studies as such as chemistry are increasing way more than in CS. 

- In addition, comparisons to similar courses at other universities may help to improve and gain general applicable results.

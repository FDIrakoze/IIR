# Resume 

Date used for this study : 142 professional software enginneers in seven organizations

## Introduction 

Lack of gender diversity in the software development profession

Female developers only account for 21% of the whole software development workforce and earn $19,514 less than their male peers

Questions ask for this study :   
> RQ1 : **Do implicit gender biases exist among software development professionals ?**  
> RQ2 : **How implicit gender biases inﬂuence software development professionals’ decision-making in assessing job candidates and evaluating contributions ?**

In this study, they measure the implicit biases based on three implicit association test : IATs

> IATS :  asks participants to categorize information as quickly as possible and then calculates a participant’s reaction time (in milliseconds) and the accuracy in completing the categorization task 

##  RESEARCH DESIGN

 142 subjects, 67 were male, and 75 were female
 diverse positions in their organizations, for example, software architect, software engineer, ...

 Before the real study, they make a pilot study in many step :   
    > Step 1: Study Introduction & Information Consent  
    > Step 2: Job Candidates Assessment Task  
    > Step 3: Contributions Evaluation Task
    > Step 4: Gender Implicit Association Tests  
    > Step 5: Modern Sexism Scale

***Measurements*** 
 Women indicates strongly prefer female candidates or their work,  men indicates strongly prefer male candidates or their work


## DATA ANALYSIS 

> **RQ1** :  D-Score and Welch’s Two Sample t-test -> standard measure for an IAT

> **RQ2** : Generalized Linear Modeling

## RESULTS AND FINDINGS

> **RQ1: Gender Implicit Bias**   
    - IATTest1:TechnicalLeadership  : software development professionals hold implicit gender biases related to technical leadership positions   
    - IATTest2:GeneralSETechnical  : software development professionals hold implicit gender biases related to general technical positions in the software development profession  
    - IAT Test 3: Gender-Career   :  software development professionals hold implicit gender biases connecting women with the home/family, as well as men with career/work  
    - IATs vs. MSS  : differences between the results of the IATs and the MSS suggest that investigating both implicit gender biases and explicit gender attitudes is necessary and important  
    - Female vs.Male : D-scoresofeachgender group in the three IATs. Both gender groups have implicit gender biases though there some slight differences regarding the degree of them

In fact : Implicit gender biases are widely existing among professional software developers. For all three IATs, the effects of associating men with Technical Leadership (Architect), General SE Technical (SE Technical), and Career are signiﬁcant for both male and female subjects

> **RQ2: Implicit Bias and Decision Making**  
    -  Task 1: Job Candidates Assessment :  The increases on implicit gender biases reduce the possibility of making decisions favoring the females  
    -  Task 2: Contributions Evaluation :   The results are similar to the Job Candidates Assessment. However, the impact of IATs seems smaller in this task through the results of General SE Technical IAT is still signiﬁcant  

In fact : Implicit gender biases have signiﬁcant impacts on professional software developers’ decision-making on job candidates assessment and contributions evaluation. Specifically, while people can resist the impact of explicit gender biases, their decisions are still largely inﬂuenced by implicit gender biases.

##  DISCUSSION 

The implicit gender biases are very likely to put female software engineers in disadvantageous situations

2 Opportunities, in order to reduce implicit gender biases :  
-  designing a series of carefully crafted and empirically tested bias reduction training courses in both educational institutions and software development organizations
- Software development organizations may proactively hire women in counter-stereotypic roles, and encourage their female employees to take technical leadership roles

## Conclusion 

With the progress of the mordern society, some people tend tobelievethat thefemalesandmales are treated almost equally now. However, the real situations are not that optimistic. While explicit gender biases are decreasing, the biases towards the females become more subtle and unconscious. The implicit gender biases still signiﬁcantly impact people’s decision and behavior. The software development profession, where gender diversity is a long-lasting problem, is not free of such implicit gender biases. 

Successfully dealing with implicit biases signals signiﬁcant culture and society progresses

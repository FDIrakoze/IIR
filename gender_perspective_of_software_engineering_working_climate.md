***`The main purpose of this study, is to explore the gender differences within the IT industry by comparing and contrasting male and females perceptions and how it affects the employee's satisfaction of he working climate`***

Women in engineering and computer science have always played a vital part throughout the history :
"n the 1970s
until the 1990s women’s participation and contribution
increased in science and engineering fields".

However today, women are often feeling insecure due to isolation, which can result the fact that their not being taken seriously by their colleagues.


***This study is conducted as a case study at a large IT company in Gothenburg, 17 000 employees and 25% of women***

> **Gender studies**   
    
    The number of women in software engineering study is decreasing.
    When women get married they usually prioritize their partner's career more than their own.
    Women usually feel more isolated during their IT study, because their is more male students   
    Female employees holding bachelor degree in computer science is decreasing.
    According to the extracted data, their less than 20% women in 2010 which have a bachelor degree in IT 
    Berenson find that for women, it's more comfortable to work in a collaborative environment.

    Their are many roel models in computer science which are women : Ada Lovelace (1st world computer programmer in 1850's), Jean Batrik, Grace Murray Hopper, Milli Koss and Thelma Estrin.

    Men are more interested in their engineering career, and their rank.

    

> **Working climate**

    Many researches show that if an organization have more diversity and mixed groups, it tend to show higher performance and produce a higher quality product.

    In software engineering the gender imbalance in teams can to lead to certain attitudes in the working climate, like more harsh jargon and higher risk to become unambitious.

    In male employees (6.7 millions male), engineering study, represent almost a third of the dregrees. In contrast there is less female employees that hold a bachelor degree in engineering field, it become evident that less women choose this path.

    By investigating and understanding the gender difference and perception of the working climate, it may inspire and motivate more women into the software engineering field. 



Some questions were defined in order to get more opinions about the differences between genders :   
    ***How do employees perceive working climate?***  
    Some sub-questions :   
    ***What are the similarities and differences between genders regarding the positive aspects that affect the working climate in the organization?***  
    ***What are the similarities and differences between genders regarding the negative aspects that affects to working climate?***


> **Data collection**

    The previous question are divided into 4 categories : 
        • Knowledge 
        • Group dynamics 
        • Assessment 
        • Other 

    6 peoples were interviewed, all from a different position within the origanization : 
        
|*F-> Female* / *M-> Male* | Role |
|---|---|
|F1|Scrum Master|
|F2|Hume ressources |
|F3|Program Manager|
|M1|Developper |
|M2|Change agent|
|M3|Line manager|

**Data analysis**

A well-known technique were used to analyse the interviews results, such as coding and creating a chain f evidence from original data and the findings.   
   - Categories -> used to sort the different types of data   
   - Color-coding -> each categories was assigned to a a color   
   - Compare and contrast the data based on the gender   

### **Findings**

    This category is based on how employees perceive support of their knowledge advancement in the company.  

        - Females 
            There are good support like training and courses for developpers 
            Negative aspect toward redundancy processed, that usually affect tge newest employees

        - Males 
            They tended to talk more about their performanc, positive support from the organization in form of education for developpers.


    B - Group dynamics 
    
    This category is based on how employees perceive the working climate with regards to how people collaborate with each other. 

        - Females 
        Term mentioned by all the interviewed women : "High performing team" 
        Foreign experience, that enhanced the working climate, having an open atmosphere, getting clear goal from the start and being pragmatic.

        "Teams that are mixed, are often better working teams"

        - Males 
        The men talked about the importance of diversity, in forms of different professional backgrounds and previous experiences combined with individual personality that  contributed in creating good group dynamics. 

        Having a mixed team, is preferable than having a "one gender team", you have to have at least 25% of the gender which you have less of in order to form a balanced group with better dynamics 
    
        Diversity is good, however sometimes this can lead to conflicts of respect due to the different ways of thinking.

## page 9 il y a un resume

There are more men studying software engineering than women and therefore naturally the industry would not be able to have an equal distribution

## Conclusion 

The working climate in the organization is most affected by individual’s characteristics and personalities rather than gender aspects, however this does not eliminate the gender aspect having an impact on the working climate
